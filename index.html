            </p>
            <p>
              This week:
              <strong>Creating doors that don’t kill the player</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Though doors are generally recognized as being the cornerstone
              that holds modern society together, what many people don’t realize
              is that the same principle holds true in video games. The Stanley
              Parable employs over a thousand doors (one thousand and two,
              specifically) and if a single one is not functioning properly it
              threatens the integrity of the entire game. That’s why we’re
              making sure to go through and test each door thoroughly before
              shipping it in the final game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today I’d like to walk you through the process of inspecting doors
              to make sure they don’t murder the player for sport.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here’s an example of a door from The Stanley Parable, as seen in
              the Hammer level editor, which is being used to create the game:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors1.jpg"
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>At first it looks just like any door in any game ever.</p>
            <p><em>Oh!</em></p>
            <p>you say,</p>
            <p>
              <em
                >everything appears to be perfectly in order! A 100% functional
                door! No need to do any sort of testing or inspection or further
                investigation of this door in any capacity, however small!</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh little fox, how ignorant you are of the world. Let’s run this
              game and find out what would actually happen if someone were to
              play it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here’s the player just walking along. Doot da doo, just gonna go
              right through this door, that’s what I’m doing…
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors2.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Just gonna go right onto the other side of – BAM!!</p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors5.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>You see? Now do you see how wrong you were? About the door?</p>
            <p><em>Oh my god, I didn’t know –</em></p>
            <p>
              Shh. I don’t need your excuses. I need solutions. Let’s look at
              how we can fix this horrible problem that you would have ushered
              unto the world if you were in charge.
            </p>
            <p>
              First we’ll open up the level editor. There’s the door! Hello!
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors6a.jpg"
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Great, so far so good. Now we’ll double click on it to open up its
              parameters.
            </p>
            <p>Aha! Here’s the problem!</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors7c.jpg"
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              You see? Its morality is set to “fuck humans.” With a setting like
              that you can expect a relatively low likelihood of this door
              treating humans like the clean, civilized, respectable creatures
              that they are. Why don’t we adjust this setting to something less
              unnecessarily hostile?
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors7d.jpg"
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Much better! Crisis averted. Now comes the task of going through
              and adjusting this setting individually for each of the thousands
              of doors (4,258 specifically) throughout The Stanley Parable. It’s
              grueling work, but if we’re not careful it’s easy to overlook some
              game-breaking gaffs, like the setting on this door that almost
              passed under our radar earlier this week:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Introducing_ The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase! _ Galactic-Cafe_files/doors8.jpg"
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              This door is a door. It is not a frog. Fool me once, as they say.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, game design is about the details. If you’re not
              applying that razor-sharp attention you run the risk of your game
              being rude, demoralizing, or racist toward your players. That’s
              not the kind of game we make, that’s a very different kind of
              game, made by very different kinds of people. I don’t want to talk
              about them. You weren’t implying we’re like them, were you?
            </p>
            <p><em>No, honestly, I never –</em></p>
            <p>
              Save it. You had your chance and you blew it. That ship has
              sailed.
            </p>
            <p><em>Oh my god, please let me out of –</em></p>
            <p>Shhhhhh.</p>

            <p>
              Let’s take a piece of reader mail, this one comes to us from
              Franklin I. of Michigan:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >I’m starting to learn game design and the biggest hurdle I keep
                running into over and over is knowing how many forklifts to put
                into my game. Could you give me a specific number? It would be a
                huge help, thanks!</strong
              >
            </p>
            <strong> </strong>
            <p><strong>-Franklin</strong></p>
            <p>
              Hey Franklin, let’s get one thing straight: There is no “specific
              number.” The appropriate number of forklifts is an art, you hear
              me? What I do is art. I’m an artist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Okay! So now that we’ve gotten that out of the way let’s dig a bit
              deeper into the correct amount of forklifts to place have in your
              game. First, open up your map.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase_ Forklifts _ Galactic-Cafe_files/forklifts1.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              So far your game is pretty terrible. That doesn’t necessarily mean
              you are terrible as a person, but it wouldn’t hurt to lose some
              sleep thinking obsessively about it.
            </p>
            <p>Now let’s add a single forklift.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase_ Forklifts _ Galactic-Cafe_files/forklifts2.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Right now you’re probably thinking:</p>
            <p>
              <em>One forklift looks pretty good, time to add a second!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Woah there cowboy! What did I just say about the number of
              forklifts being an art? You can’t just rush into a decision like
              that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why don’t we take some time simply to be with the number of
              forklifts that are currently in the game? Let’s feel it out by
              meditating on it our current game for one week.

              Okay! One week should have passed since you were last here, so
              let’s return to our map and see how we feel about it now.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>You’re right, it does need more forklifts.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase_ Forklifts _ Galactic-Cafe_files/forklifts3.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, it’s important to take some time to feel out the emotional
              weight of this decision. Let’s take another week of reflection and
              deep self discovery.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>Hm.</p>
            <p>In that week that just passed, something stirred in me.</p>
            <p>Something profound. I feel…affected.</p>
            <p>Is it the intangible nature of our mortality?</p>
            <p>
              Is my spirit swelling, ballooning the fabric that holds the
              universe together?
            </p>
            <p>Who am I?</p>
            <p>What is my purpose?</p>
            <p>Life is so short.</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>
              I don’t yet know what this all means, but there could be no better
              way to express it than through the act of creation. I feel like I
              finally see what this map is trying to become, let’s take it there
              now:

            <p>
              This week: <strong>Admitting that you’ve made mistakes</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost everyone is human, which means that almost everyone makes
              mistakes. Sure, the pain of making a mistake so wretched and
              vicious it’s nearly unbearable, but it’s even more painful to have
              to admit your mistake to others. Today I’m going to show you how
              to communicate your errors to your teammates in a healthy and
              graceful manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              First let’s look at the mistake I made. The texture on this floor
              needs to be carpet instead of wood. It’s a simple change.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Making Mistakes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/M1.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Instead, I accidentally delete the entire map.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Making Mistakes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/M2.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>In a blind panic, I save the file. Everything is lost.</p>
            <p>
              I’ve made a mistake. Again, it’s important to remember that
              everyone makes mistakes and you are still normal and that I love
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it’s also important to regain composure and handle the
              situation with precision if you want to do any damage control.
              This can be resolved if we stay calm. Let’s think about the
              situation logically:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Everything that was lost was inside the map file</li>
              <li>
                If the map file doesn’t exist, no one will know you deleted
                everything in it
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The only logical answer is to delete the map file.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Making Mistakes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/M3.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Perfect! Or is it?</p>
            <p>
              Look closer. Isn’t is suspicious that that’s the only missing map
              file? Weren’t you supposed to be editing that particular map? If
              anyone sees that this file is missing they’ll know without a doubt
              that it was you who fucked up.
            </p>
            <p>Our only option is to delete the rest of the maps as well.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Making Mistakes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/M4.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Good, this is much better.</p>
            <p>
              But I’m still uneasy. I’m not worried about being caught, I’m
              thinking about what kind of man I am. I’m a real man, I own a real
              shirt, I built a house once. When I start something I follow
              through, and right now this feels to me like a half-assed job.
              That just doesn’t sit right in my stomach.
            </p>
            <p>I think I’m going to delete every file in the entire game.</p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>Be sure to empty the recycle bin!</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Making Mistakes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/M6.jpg"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Outstanding! You’ve just permanently erased every file from your
              team’s shared Dropbox.
            </p>
            <p>High five yourself.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
              Uh oh, here’s William, the lead level designer on Stanley Parable.
              It seems he’s discovered my “mistake” and wants to talk. As a team
              leader, this seems like a good opportunity for me to discuss the
              game’s radical new direction with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems he’s exhibiting a “negative” response to the news. Let’s
              do some damage control: what can we say that will convince him
              there’s no possible way you could have been responsible for
              erasing the game?
            </p>

              This week: <strong>A fireside chat with William Pugh!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              I thought we’d try something different this week. I sat down and
              recorded a short conversation with William Pugh, who is doing most
              of the actual level design and mapping for the new Stanley
              Parable! In this installment we discussed how the two of us met
              and what our initial expectations for the game were compared to
              what ended up happening throughout development. We both learned a
              lot about one another, souls were searched. I invite you to listen
              in on this peek into our collaborative creative process!

              These little chats are a nice break from the pressure of having to
              write a new Helpful Development Showcase every week, I’m thinking
              of once a month posting one of these talks between William and
              myself. If you guys are keen on that then we’ll write that into
              the schedule!
            </p>
            <p>Thanks everyone!</p>

                connecting you to the development of The Stanley Parable by
                giving you a small look at what’s been going on behind the
                scenes. Each week we’ll give you a tiny peek into what it takes
                to make a game like The Stanley Parable, the creative challenges
                we come up against in the course of development, and how to not
                judge yourself as a person for the quality of choices you’ve

              Thanks Martin, it’s always a pleasure to hear responses like
              yours! Here at Galactic Café we take a lot of pride in creating
              storylines that resemble trainwrecks, totally devoid of value,
              impenetrable in every way, even bordering on spiteful toward the
              player.
            </p>

              This week:

                >How to actively sabotage the quality of your game’s
                story</strong

            </p>
            <p>
              Wrecking your own game isn’t just good for your players, it’s also
              tremendously rewarding! To demonstrate, I’m going to start with a
              video game whose narrative is extremely high quality, and work my
              way down toward filth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here’s our example game.<br />
              It features two characters, on the left is
              <strong>Marsh</strong> and on the right is <strong>Chev</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Paradoxes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/paradox0.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              To see the story, let’s look at their characters’ Attributes. In
              this case, Chev and Marsh’s Attributes determine their
              relationship with one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Paradoxes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/paradox0b.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>This is a high quality story.</p>
            <p>
              If your goal is to deeply impact your players, to inspire them
              with an emotional tale of the human condition, stop now. You won’t
              get any better than this.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, if you want a game that alienates and harasses
              your players, causing them to feel weak and unloved in a cold,
              brutal world, well then let’s continue!
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re going to add another Attribute to Marsh to help confuse and
              contradict the story.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Paradoxes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Marsh1.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Great! See how already the narrative has stopped making total
              sense? That’s the effect that we’re looking for here.
            </p>
            <p>
              But we’re only just getting started, let’s take it another step
              forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Paradoxes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Chev1.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p><em>What??</em></p>
            <p>your players should be asking at this point,</p>
            <p>
              <em
                >How can Marsh both love and not love Chev?? How can Chev love
                Marsh and not actually know her?!?</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              This is an appropriate response, it means that we’re getting
              closer to infuriating the player with a huge pile of narrative
              nonsense. But someone stubborn enough could probably still make
              some sort of artsy bullshit sense out of this game, so let’s push
              it even further.

            <p>YES. I LOVE IT. MORE!</p>
            <p>
              <img

            </p>
            <p>
              Hm. Okay, I think you stumbled a bit there, it’s actually totally
              plausible that Marsh could be Swedish. In fact, if anything this
              detail probably causes the story to make MORE sense. Could you
              come up with something else?
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Paradoxes _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Marsh4.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Perfect! You can clearly see from the screenshot that Marsh has
              arms, this Attribute sends us further into Nonsenseville.

              …is probably what your players are thinking right now as they’re
              playing your game. They came here for a normal, rational, coherent
              story! And instead they got a life lesson about not trusting me to
              give them something normal.

            </p>
            <p>
              Could we take this even further and confuse the story even more?
              Of course we could, there is always more nonsense out there,
              always new piles of shit to heap onto your work, always a greater
              sense of sheer hatred you could be conveying to your players.
              Believe in your dreams.

              and reflect on how far we’ve come. To actually step into the lives
              of Chev and Marsh.

              This week:
              <strong>A critical analysis of last week’s blog post</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You may recall that in
              <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160819141439/http://www.galactic-cafe.com/2013/03/the-stanley-parable-dev-showcase-paradoxes/"
                >last week’s installment of the Stanley Parable Helpful
                Development Showcase</a
              >, I explored narrative paradoxes and how to use them to make your
              game objectively terrible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m very upset to report that after careful consideration, it
              seems that my presentation was incredibly flawed, and that much of
              the information I presented as fact appears to have been an utter
              fabrication. This week I would like to set the record straight by
              explaining what exactly was misreported and to correct any logical
              inconsistencies.
            </p>
            <p>Right off the bat I dropped this turd:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “<span style="color: #c0c0c0"
                  >Wrecking your own game isn’t just good for your players, it’s
                  also tremendously rewarding!</span
                >“
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This is a boldface lie, actively sabotaging my game’s narrative is
              in no way rewarding. In fact it’s one of the most emotionally
              destructive things I’ve ever done.&nbsp;I wake up every morning in
              cold sweats, I live the day in a nauseous haze, and I go to bed a
              horrible, anxious, miserable shell of a human being.&nbsp;I can
              directly attribute this to my work making my game’s story
              terrible, and I apologize for leading people to think I enjoy it.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is by far the most racist mistake that I made, and though
              several other inaccuracies were nearly as racist, I feel like this
              one deserves a specific apology.
            </p>
            <p>I then presented these two characters, named Chev and Marsh:</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Self Review _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Marsh1.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
              />
            </p>
            <p>And made the following claim:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “<span style="color: #c0c0c0"
                  >See how already the narrative has stopped making total sense?
                  That’s the effect that we’re looking for here.</span
                >“
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This too is a falsehood, the story in fact makes perfect sense.
              “Love,” as referenced in the second Attribute, is the name of a
              gay bar on 32nd street. While Marsh has deep affections for Chev,
              she is not currently inside Love with him, nor is she in any gay
              bar anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, I feel the racist undertones of this mistake deserves
              specific acknowledgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a number of minor gaffs throughout the next several
              lines (fluctuating in severity of racism), but in particular I
              want to call attention to this statement, which I made toward the
              end of the article:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “<span style="color: #c0c0c0"
                  >Could we take this even further and confuse the story even
                  more? Of course we could, there is always more nonsense out
                  there, always new piles of shit to heap onto your work, always
                  a greater sense of sheer hatred you could be conveying to your
                  players. Believe in your dreams.</span
                >“
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This is perhaps the most egregious element of the entire blog
              post, and I feel sickened for having posted it. The truth is that
              there is no more nonsense in the world than what I depicted in
              this article. I used all of it, saving none for others to aspire
              to. I encouraged children to pursue even greater heights of
              absurdity, knowing it was a futile task.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not three hours after posting this, I received an email from a
              small German child:
            </p>

                width="100%"
              />
            </p>

              What have I done?? I filled a terminally ill child with hopes and
              dreams for a future that he’ll never actually see. And then he’ll
              die, like all animals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ashamed at what I had done, I hastily booked a plane to Germany to
              see the child before he passed away.

              When I landed it turned out I had booked a flight to the wrong
              Germany. I got on another plane.

            I arrived at the boy’s bedside moments before he died.
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Next to him was a computer. He had been writing something. The
              story, for a video game. “Oh please god,” I thought to myself,
              “please let it be terrible. Please let Franz have created the
              piece of shit he dreamed of. Please let me not have polluted his
              final moments on this earth.” In a cold sweat, the dying boy at my
              side, I read through his writing, his final testament to the
              world.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              It was the most beautiful story I had ever read.<br />
              Franz died in brutal agony.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Franz may have been the first German boy whose life I ruined as a
              result of something I posted on this blog, but with your help he
              can also be the last. It is with this goal in mind that I have
              founded the Franz Baumgaertner Memorial Fund.

              The Franz Baumgaertner Memorial Fund will directly impact children
              all over the world, children just like Franz, who believed in a
              dream that was impossible. 100% of the funds we receive will go
              toward educating children not to wish for something that’s
              impossible, or stupid. Kids don’t know what’s good for them, and
              together, we’ll keep it that way.

                >The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase is our way of
                connecting you to the development of The Stanley Parable by
                giving you a small look at what’s been going on behind the
                scenes. Each week we’ll give you a tiny peek into what it takes
                to make a game like The Stanley Parable, the creative challenges
                we come up against in the course of development, and how to not
                judge yourself as a person for the quality of choices you’ve
                made in your own life. These are just a few of the topics we’ll
                cover in this incredibly useful blog series.</em

            </p>
            <p>This week we’ve got an email from Robert I. of Michigan:</p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >The stanley parable was good but it was too short. I won’t pay
                for the remake unless it’s longer.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Don’t worry Robert, we’ve got you covered! Here at Galactic Café
              know that when you spend money on a piece of entertainment you
              expect to be occupied by that thing for a reasonable amount of
              time. Besides, if you’re poor why would you want to waste more
              time playing video games? Get a job, hippie.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I’m pleased to announce that The Stanley Parable: HD
              Remix will actually scale in length depending on how much money
              you spend on it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s look at one example: Suppose that you spend, say, $10 on the
              game. In that case, the narration in the game might sound
              something like this:
            </p>
            <audio controls="controls">
              <source src="speedA.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
            </audio>
            <p>
              Now let’s suppose that you spent $50 on the game! WOAH!! You’re
              after an experience! Here’s what you can expect that same line of
              dialogue to sound like.
            </p>
            <audio controls="controls">
              <source src="speedB.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
            </audio>
            <p>
              You see, the more money you pay the longer the game will take. If
              you’re really loaded, a single playthrough of the game could last
              years!
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, you will be able to download the game for free, but
              that same dialogue will sound like this:
            </p>
            <audio controls="controls">
              <source src="speedC.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
            </audio>
            <p>
              But of course there’s more than one way to affect the game’s
              length. Loaded Lucy who spends generously on the game will find
              that her character’s speed will be adjusted thusly:
            </p>
            <p>
              <iframe
                src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919213356if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/GLLcmPZs83U"
                frameborder="0"
                width="560"
                height="315"
              ></iframe>
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh, but here’s Deadbeat Dana who couldn’t contribute more than a
              dollar. Boo hoo Dana, way to spread the pain around. You’ll only
              get to spend a few minutes playing Stanley Parable because this is
              how fast your character will move through the game:
            </p>
            <p>
              <iframe
                src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919213356if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/uFxmvJfE1PQ"
                frameborder="0"
                width="560"
                height="315"
              ></iframe>
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond simply affecting the length of the game’s play time, we
              also want to make the game a more pleasant experience for those
              who pay more money. So if you pay above $20, at random times
              throughout the game the Narrator will give you compliments! Here
              is one example of a compliment he might give deliver:
            </p>
            <audio controls="controls">
              <source src="complimentA.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
            </audio>
            <p>Another example of a possible compliment:</p>
            <audio controls="controls">
              <source src="complimentB.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
            </audio>
            <p>
              Alternatively, if you choose to play the free version of The
              Stanley Parable, this sound clip will play at random times
              throughout the game:

              Although the weekly Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase
              devblogs are a cherished weekly internet tradition, they are not
              without a cost. They take time to make! And energy! And when
              they’re really complex, both! So once a month, we’ll be Stalling
              For Time with an update that was just a little bit easier for us
              to make.

                >when we did this a month ago</a
              >, I decided to sit down with William Pugh (the level designer for
              The Stanley Parable) to talk about life and video games. But what
              started with a simple inquiry evolved into an examination of our
              relationship. Sides of one another we didn’t even know about were
              revealed, at least one terribly lie was confessed for the first
              time, and business transactions were made. It is an intensely
              erotic* 20 minutes.

            <p>This week: <strong>Writing to the press</strong></p>
            <p>
              The role of promotion in game develop cannot be understated.
              Seriously, go ahead, try.
            </p>
            <p>You see? Impossible.</p>
            <p>
              Because marketing is so instrumental in determining the success or
              failure of your game, it’s important to maintain a healthy
              relationship with members of the press. Creating a personal
              connection with a journalist can be the difference between your
              game becoming a huge hit and it being personally responsible for
              the slaughter of thousands of innocent children in third-world
              countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s look at how I handle my relationships with the video game
              press.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suppose that I have some new bit of news about the development of
              the Stanley Parable (I don’t. Don’t ask). I’m going to offer it to
              <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151012015513/http://kotaku.com/tag/kirk-hamilton"
                >Kirk Hamilton</a
              >
              over at Kotaku as an exclusive piece. Offering these kinds of
              exclusives helps sustain a connection between developer and
              journalist, it tells them that you believe in what they’re doing.
              Press is about creating that kind of lasting connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I send this email though, I’m going to do some heavy
              drinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              First up is a fifth of Jack Daniels. Not the whole thing
              obviously, just enough to make it legally inadvisable for me to
              get into the driver’s seat of a car.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Next is most of a bottle of UV, flavored vodka, which is a great
              way of letting people know that you like to drink but you also
              have a great personality.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we’ll get classy. Just a few shots of Balblair, premium single
              malt scotch whiskey.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>One of these, I guess.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/cocktail.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Don’t even know what this is.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/strange.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Now let’s finish off the JD.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/JD.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Perfect!</p>
            <p>Let’s sit down to write this email.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/kirk.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the full text of the email I found in my gmail outbox the
              next morning.
            </p>
            <p>This might be bad for the game’s press.</p>
            <p>
              It’s time to do some damage control. Kirk is a gentleman, an
              upstanding and understanding kind of guy. I know that the two of
              us can talk it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s write him an email to try to smooth things over and bring
              him back to our side:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/kirk2.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, it’s all about creating a connection. Now that Kirk thinks
              I love him, it will be impossible for him not to write some
              glowing coverage of the Stanley Parable.
            </p>
            <p>Oh! We’ve gotten an email back from him!</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/kirk3.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out that Kirk Hamilton’s email address is NOT
              kirk@yahoo.com, so for now, it looks like I’m safe as far as press
              for Stanley Parable.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this other guy at kirk@yahoo.com is still a problem. I came on
              pretty strong in that last email, and now he’s probably developing
              feelings for me. We need to lay this beast to rest as gently as
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Press _ Galactic-Cafe_files/kirk4.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              But he’s still trying to win me back. The next day I get this in
              my inbox.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              You see, he’s playing hard to get, and I’m not falling for it. You
              had your chance, kirk@yahoo.com, and you blew it. It’s too late
              now, I’ve deleted him from my email contacts so that I’ll never be
              able to write him again, never send him my thoughts when I’m
              lonely, never fill that kirk@yahoo.com-shaped hole in my heart.
            </p>
            <p>Goodbye forever, old friend.</p>
            <p>Goodbye.</p>

            <p>
              So I’ve been writing the Stanley Parable Helpful Development
              Showcases once a week for a few months now, and while they’ve
              gotten a great response, they are not without a cost. They take
              time and energy, and I want to make sure that the quality and
              effectiveness of these posts outweigh the costs of making them.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a plane recently I began brainstorming new HDS topics, and I
              found that consistently they were extremely negative! Like, how to
              abuse your teammates, or how to abuse your fans, or whatever.
              Eventually I looked down at the paper and wondered what I was
              doing to myself that I could only think of these kinds of
              incredibly brutal topics to write about! Perhaps I’m just not
              having as much fun writing these as I used to?
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way, I don’t think the stress of writing a new installment
              every week is helping.
              <strong
                >So I’m going to be cutting back installments of the helpful
                development showcase to one every two weeks.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope this eases the pressure off me and gives me more energy to
              make these on a consistent basis and have them still be fun and
              interesting for people, rather than just background noise. And
              honestly, if I ever think that what I’m making is just garbage,
              I’ll stop writing them all together and not waste either of our
              time. I want creation and enjoyment of those creations to be fun!
              If it ever becomes a chore, we’ll change things up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, thank you for understanding! I want my energy to go only
              into making cool shit, and I’m still figuring out how to do that.
              Thank you for riding this roller coaster with me, I have no idea
              where it’s all going and I’m continually excited to find out!

            <p>This week: <strong>Creating games with emotion</strong></p>
            <p>Time and time again, people ask me: “<em>Davey…why???</em>”</p>
            <p>
              This is followed by a lot of crying. Then, the person composes
              themselves, and asks me the second most common question:
            </p>
            <p>“<em>How do you create a game with emotions?</em>”</p>
            <p>
              This is a question that people have been asking ever since video
              games were first invented in 1993 by Mr. Games. The solution is
              simple. It’s not enough to merely create a game with emotions in
              it, you have to actually use your emotions to create the game
              itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s look at a demonstration of how we are creating the Stanley
              Parable. I encourage you to follow along at home and try to make a
              game for yourself using this methodology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a picture of me at my desk, in front of the game’s level
              editor, ready to do work.

              I’m going to start off by feeling ashamed of myself and everything
              I’ve ever done in my life.

            <p>Already you can see the map starting to come together.</p>
            <p>
              Now I’m going to take a step back weigh my perception of the
              universe against the infinite collective perception of everyone
              around me and how by the very nature of not directly experiencing
              these modes of perception I internalize them as dangerous and
              frightening, threatening to the identity that I have formed as an
              individual which allows me to remain shallow and protected in a
              perpetual bubble of self-inflicted ignorance.

            <p>
              Be careful as you attempt this one at home, if you feel it’s too
              advanced for you there’s no shame in waiting until you have more
              game development experience under your belt.

              I’m not exactly sure what emotion this is? I don’t think there’s a
              word for it yet, I was mostly just improvising.

              After creating a game using this methodology, you should actually
              feel more deeply in touch with yourself as a person, able to
              express yourself and demonstrate compassion for others to a depth
              you never understood before, that kind of nonsense.

            <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Shortly after posting this blog, I received an email from Heavy
              Rain creator, David Cage:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="80%"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              David Cage’s claims are preposterous. Not only is this method not
              his, it can be found in the appendix of any grade school-level
              textbook on game design.
            </p>
            <p>
              I won’t be bullied by David Cage, and I encourage you to join me
              in this fight. Too many small developers making emotional games
              have been absorbed into the David Cage empire, and it’s time we
              stood up for ourselves. Together, we will be stronger than David
              Cage could ever be.
            </p>

              William Pugh is the level designer for The Stanley Parable, he
              makes the game nice and pretty. Since the very first post on this
              blog, he has pestered me on a near perpetual basis to allow him to
              write his own Helpful Development Showcase blog post, and of
              course I shoot him down every time because
              <em
                >which one of us wrote a successful video game oh wait it was me

            <p>
              But this particular week, after what can only be described as a
              combination of forgetfulness and wilful neglect of my duty as blog
              writer, William stepped up to the plate and wrote an update. What
              follows is copied straight out of the document he sent me, I will
              be press ‘publish’ without actually looking at what he’s written,
              just to humour him and because why not. This should be fun.

            <p>
              Hello my name is William Pugh co-creator of The Stanley Parable:
              HD Remix, and while Davey Wreden (the other co-creator) is writing
              these ridiculous blog posts I’m the one who’s
              <strong>actually making the game.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now both you and me know that these “Helpful Development
              Showcases” don’t actually reveal anything about the ACTUAL Stanley
              Parable game’s development process so I’m going to venture off
              script here and tell you fools about what it’s REALLY LIKE TO MAKE
              A GAME LIKE THE STANLEY PARABLE.
            </p>
            <p>
              THIS WEEK’S SUBJECT IS:
              <strong
                >HOW TO HIDE SECRETS IN YOUR GAME WITHOUT TEAM MEMBERS FINDING
                OUT ABOUT THEM</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              So you want to put secrets in your game? But your uptight
              co-workers don’t trust your creative instinct and your ability to
              exercise self restraint? All you need to do is let them experience
              your brilliance through discovery! Don’t tell them you’re hiding
              secrets in their game!
            </p>
            <p>Okay here’s an example.</p>
            <p>
              This is the Corridor Ending (which is brand new to the Stanley
              Parable HD Remix). Davey wrote it so that the player walks down
              this corridor for ever and the only way for the player to end the
              game is for him/her to stop walking. This sends some bullshit arty
              farty message about the nature of struggling against your
              surroundings and conflict and blah blah blah.
            </p>
            <p><strong>This is not how you make a good video game.</strong></p>
            <p>
              Davey doesn’t know this but I have ‘enhanced’ this ending with a
              few special touches.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, this is a video of how the ending normally plays.
            </p>
            <p>
              <iframe
                src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919213356if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/H8AgA3Aj5DM"

              ></iframe>
            </p>
            <p>
              But did you notice anything other than Davey’s questionable choice
              of background music or his horrible ending concept?
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes you’re right! That green secret wall painting is VERY
              secretive looking!
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s have a look at what happens if we play this ending again but
              after clicking on the secret painting.
            </p>
            <p>
              <iframe
                src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919213356if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/OggYoZ9Orxg"
                frameborder="0"
                width="560"
                height="315"
              ></iframe>
            </p>
            <p>Secret signs! Secret music! Secret sound effects!!</p>
            <p>
              That’s right – this ending has the signature of a genius all over
              it, and that signature reads:
              <strong><font size="5">WILLIAM WAS HERE!!!</font></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I hear you thinking – “Man oh man, those secret signs, secret
              music and secret sound effects showed me a whole new secret world
              full of secrets!! How can I go back to playing the normal Stanley
              Parable after that?”
            </p>
            <p>The answer is: YOU CAN’T!!!</p>
            <p>
              That’s right – once you click on the secret painting there is no
              going back.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every single section of the game will be full of secrets – ONCE
              YOU GO SECRET YOU NEVER GO BECRET!!

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
            <p>
              Davey here, just finished reading. I’d like to issue a few
              clarifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the Corridor Ending is not real. Never in a thousand years
              would I write something so banal and superficial that doesn’t
              speak to the true nature of struggle and universal indifference
              that the individual must confront on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, let me take this moment to state definitively that The
              Stanley Parable is NOT a game about secrets, nor do I intend to
              allow secrets in the final game. I will be going through the game
              and systematically deleting all of William’s hidden “secrets.” He
              has grossly misrepresented this game’s intentions, and that
              mistake will be reflected in his percentage of revenue share.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please, please do not let this blog post be a reflection of the
              true quality of The Stanley Parable.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>UPDATE #2:</p>
            <p>
              This is William. The real secret is that I haven’t told Davey
              where all of the actual secrets are hidden. THE STANLEY PARABLE
              SECRETS FOR PRESIDENT 2013 DON’T STOP BELIEVING.

            <p>Unbelievable.</p>
            <p>
              It took a full year and a half, since the original release of The
              Stanley Parable in 2011, but someone finally got it. Someone
              finally understands what The Stanley Parable is truly about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me back up and explain, and I’ll walk you through the secret
              meaning behind TSP that Noel has uncovered.

            <p>Two choices. One will save you, one will kill you.</p>
            <p>Or is that the full story?</p>
            <p>
              Because no matter which door you take, there is always death
              waiting down some corridor, always some gruesome fate toward which
              the Narrator will guide you. And then, no matter how you die, you
              are returned to the start. Reborn.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              You are a baby, returned to the womb. And when you emerge, what do
              you find?
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Hidden Meaning _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Meaning1.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Your mother’s teats, each one promising you sustenance, nutrition,
              life.
            </p>
            <p>Or at least, that’s how it’s supposed to go.</p>
            <p>
              Because in this world, no matter what you choose you are led once
              again back to the grave. Simply by choosing a door, by drinking
              the milk from your mother’s breasts, you are doomed to die over
              and over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why? Perhaps because her breasts have been corrupted by the
              influence of the male in this story, the Narrator. Patriarchy
              oppresses, it denies the woman her say, her role. No matter how
              she participates in this world, her child is taken from her and
              condemned to die. Is the Narrator your father? Perpetually
              attempting to wrest control of the fate of the family away from
              the mother? I didn’t say that, you did.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are confronted by the crushers, and a female Narrator
              steps in to speak, she warns Stanley. She knows the truth, she has
              seen what society does to women. No matter which door, which
              breast Stanley chooses, he is doomed. The only option is to leave
              this world, as she says, “push escape and press quit.”
            </p>
            <p>But is there an escape?</p>
            <p>Down one path is a hole in the ground.</p>
            <p>
              <img
                width="100%"
                src="./The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Hidden Meaning _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Meaning4.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Entering into the hole, for the first time, places the Narrator at
              a distance, he loses his influence. And at the end of a tunnel of
              blackness you emerge into…
            </p>
            <p>
              The original office, except with no Narrator. A world without man,
              without the patriarchal oppression. Here Stanley can once again
              access the two doors, but he is not forced down either path. Free
              to choose, to be with his mother, drink her milk, free from
              society.
            </p>
            <p>
              The black hole that led to this freedom…was it a vagina? Does
              escape lie in the female body itself? Again, just repeating your
              words.

            </p>
            <p>
              Which door will you choose? And does it matter? Whichever breast
              you drink the life-restoring milk from, are you not simply
              choosing your own demise? Are you not just validating the
              institutionalized oppression of women? Simply by having breasts is
              it expected that one conform to the rigors of a patriarchal
              society mired in the inevitability of death and rebirth? The
              Stanley Parable is all of these questions and none of them, one’s
              eternal struggle against oneself, the ruination of a society
              internally defiled by its own malicious foundation.
            </p>
            <p>Or to put it into a single, all-encapsulating summation:</p>

              Thank you Noel. Thank you for giving me the strength to share what
              The Stanley Parable is really about. I hope this cleared up any
              and all confusion.

            <p>This week: <strong>How not to give into pressure</strong></p>
            <p>
              As a highly-recognized celebrity game developer, I’m under
              constant pressure from the people around me to modify and make
              additions to my game simply to serve their own needs. These are
              people who think only of themselves and have little or not
              consideration for Art. They might not even know what Art means!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you came to this blog to find out what Art means, let me point
              you to this excerpt from Dictionary.com:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/ArtDefinition.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              This definition is what I turn to whenever I’m uncertain about the
              quality of my work. It gives me the strength I need to shoot down
              other peoples’ opinions mercilessly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s look at one example of how I respond to pressure from the
              public to steer the direction of Stanley Parable one way or the
              other. Here’s a screenshot from the game’s Greenlight page:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Smithy.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              See how I got all excited and acted as though I was going to use
              Smithy’s idea?
            </p>
            <p>That’s because I did. It’s in the game.</p>
            <p>It’s a great idea.</p>
            <p>I’m not going to turn down great ideas.</p>
            <p>
              Here’s another example of the tough-love attitude you have to take
              when members of the public try to get their dirty fingers all over
              your creation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Spartan.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Obviously this one is also going in.</p>
            <p>
              The guy sounds passionate about squid. Don’t you see it in his
              words? In his words between the words? He isn’t just asking me to
              put squid in the game, he’s telling me that for him, squid IS the
              game. Will he play this game and see anything but squid? Or
              rather, can he look at a squid and see anything but The Stanley
              Parable? I can’t answer that question, nor do I intend to. All I
              can do is bring this young boy’s dream to life.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s another example of a suggestion from the public:</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/benjamoose.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Foots needs to be in this game.</p>
            <p>The Stanley Parable needs Mr. Foots.</p>
            <p>
              Mr. Foots the mathematical wizard, deconstructor of numbers, of
              the universe. He who sees it from all angles, who can manipulate
              the fabric of time to his will.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is he so tall? Did he choose this height or was it forced on
              him? Will he ever be shorter? Does he measure himself in inches or
              in quarter-inches? These are the kinds of unanswerable questions
              that get to the root of what Stanley Parable is all about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Foots is an enigma, he sees without seeing, he knows without
              knowing. He is everywhere and nowhere. Is it a stretch to say that
              he IS the stanley parable? No, no it is not. No stretching
              required.<br />
            </p>
            <center>
              <br />
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/foots.jpg"
              />
            </center>
            <p></p>
            <p>Hm….</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>
              These suggestions from fans, they’re so pure, so genuine…it’s like
              they know my own game better than I do…
            </p>
            <p>Once again, I turn to the public for help:</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/davey.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Slowly, in response to my request for ideas, a cohesive picture of
              what The Stanley Parable should be begins to emerge:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/responses.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              I include all of these suggestions and more, and already the game
              feels much more cohesive. I can tell it’s coming together now,
              it’s got life to it.
            </p>
            <p>But it’s still missing something.</p>
            <p>
              I turn to the only real source of wisdom any of us have in our
              lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/obama1.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Minutes later, I get an email back:</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/obama2.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              At last, hope! Could this response hold the answers I’ve been
              looking for?
            </p>
            <p>
              Eagerly, I go to Dictionary.com and pull up the definition of Art:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./Stanley Parable Dev Showcase_ Pressure _ Galactic-Cafe_files/Art-definition-2.jpg"
              />
            </p>
            <p>He got me again! I’ve fallen for that one too many times.</p>
            <p>
              So perhaps all of my questions haven’t been answered, but that’s
              okay. Sure, there are times when I’m uncertain of my work and
              doubtful of my abilities, but it’s probably healthy to be at least
              a little bit skeptical of yourself. Otherwise how would I be able
              to accept when my work isn’t up to par? That’s why I keep good
              friends and community close at hand, to keep me in check and watch
              my back. It’s these friends who guide me ever on that eternal

                >The Stanley Parable Helpful Development Showcase is our way of
                connecting you to the development of The Stanley Parable by
                giving you a small look at what’s been going on behind the
                scenes. Each week we’ll give you a tiny peek into what it takes
                to make a game like The Stanley Parable, the creative challenges
                we come up against in the course of development, and how to not
                judge yourself as a person for the quality of choices you’ve
                made in your own life. These are just a few of the topics we’ll
                cover in this incredibly useful blog series.</em

            <p>This week: <strong>Special Edition Packages</strong></p>
            <p>
              Here at Galactic Cafe, we recognize that our players come from all
              walks of life, and that each person who discovers the Stanley
              Parable has a different set of needs and desires. How could we
              address the variety of our players by giving them only one
              product?
            </p>
            <p>
              That is why The Stanley Parable will ship with a variety of
              Special Edition Packages, each designed to cater to the specific
              needs of someone somewhere. Depending on your generosity, you have
              the option of any one of these lovingly crafted Special Edition
              Packages, which I'm very excited to share with you today:

              We will send you both the 10-cent coin and 20-cent coin sent to us
              by one donor at each of the previous two price levels. Instead of
              sending them their promised rewards, we will send them a picture
              of you in an envelope along with a note that says “You aren't
              getting the reward we promised you because [<em
                >your name here!</em

              Who does that $1 donor think they are, stealing the reward
              promised to an innocent person who paid good money? It’s sickening
              what they think they can get away with.
            </p>
            <p>
              With your $4 we will hire a hitman to intimidate the $1 donor. The
              hitman will spend one week in a van parked in front of the
              person’s house, staring at them 24/7 through a pair of binoculars.
              Once during that week, they will be visible outside the van,
              looking at the person who paid $1 and pounding one fist into their
              other hand over and over.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The hitman from the $4 level is quite a coward, isn’t he? He’s got
              no problem resorting to cheap bullying tactics, why? Because he
              got paid? Oh, that’s a reason. Big fucking man over here, preying
              on others for cash, someone ought to show him how it feels.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ll hire a second hitman to intimidate the first. The second
              hitman trained the first hitman, so he knows all of his weaknesses
              and vulnerabilities. During training he also taught the first
              hitman a number of highly flawed techniques, just to have the
              upper hand in the event that the student ever turned on the
              teacher.
            </p>
            <p>That’ll show him.</p>
            <p><em>This version does not include The Stanley Parable</em></p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="Stanley%20Parable%20Dev%20Showcase_Gamasutra_Special%20Editions_files/SE6.png"

            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The second hitman doesn’t know it, but the person he thought he
              was training was actually the hitman who trained HIM! After
              educating the second hitman many years ago, the first hitman faked
              his own death by pretending to fall into a chasm deep within a
              Tibetan mountain. With the rest of the secret hitman society
              believing him dead, he lived at the base of the chasm for 12
              years. When he emerged he infiltrated the secret hitman society by
              posing as a mail carrier. With access to the society’s record
              books he tracked down his former pupil. Knowing that HE had taught
              the second hitman a wide array of tactics with counter-maneuvers
              that only he knew, that he would have an advantage over the second
              hitman if the two ever confronted.
            </p>
            <p>
              He then solicited the second hitman for hitman lessons, pretending
              to be a rookie, knowing that it would cement in the second
              hitman’s mind his belief that he would have the advantage over the
              first. This security measure would ensure that if for any reason
              anyone ever wanted to eliminate the first hitman, they would in
              all likelihood hire his “teacher,” believing the teacher to be
              more skilled, while in fact it was the “student” who would have
              the upper hand and therefore have a clean break and an easy
              getaway. Genius.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will use your $15 to hire a third hitman, who’s never met
              either of the first two. The third hitman isn’t great, but he’ll
              train a fourth hitman (who’s blind, so he won’t know the identity
              of his teacher in order to plot against him) to be skilled in all
              the areas that the first hitman is weak in. Many years from now,
              after the fourth hitman is highly trained, he and the first hitman
              will duel. You will be sent a text description of the battle
              written by a person with no hands.

            <p>There is a secret fifth hitman. Stay with me.</p>
            <p>
              When a hitman dies, his or her name is passed onto a newly
              anointed, unnamed hitman. When the first hitman threw himself into
              the chasm, his secret hitman name was given to a new hitman. But
              the first hitman had been lying about his true name all along, he
              had given a false name to the secret hitman society. HIS teacher
              knew this, and thus in secret, gave the first hitman’s true name
              to a pupil who was trained in secret, away from the knowledge of
              the rest of the clan. This is how the first hitman, posing as a
              mail carrier, failed to notice that another hitman carried his
              true name.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fifth hitman isn’t actually very good. We’ll just hire him to
              watch the battle between the first and fourth hitmen.

              Okay, scroll back up to the $15 level. See at the end that guy
              with no hands who’s supposed to write a description of the battle
              between the first and fourth hitman? He’s secretly the third
              hitman in disguise, who’s actually the hitman who received the
              first hitman’s fake name when he fell into the cavern, so he
              formed a fake name to disguise his fake name and then cut off his
              hands. I think he just got carried away? Not sure why he cut off
              his hands.

            <p>
              There is a dance passed down by the secret hitman society that all
              hitmen must perform when they meet in combat.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              <img

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the dance that the first and fourth hitmen perform when
              they square off. However, because the first hitman hid out for
              twelve years, he did not know that the dance had been changed.
              Instead, he performed the old dance and made this crucial mistake:
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the rules of THIS dance, the first and fourth hitmen are now
              married. It's the most beautiful story ever told.

              Why do hitmen have to die? Flawed techniques, faking deaths, made
              up names, what is it all for? In the end, is it all worth it?
            </p>
            <p>
              The third hitman thinks about this all the time, he struggles
              under the weight of his own existence. And he’s been through so
              much, I think we should do something nice for him.

              This week:
              <strong>Healthy communication between teammates</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a team leader means prioritizing healthy communication over
              personal feelings. For example, anyone who's ever led a creative
              team knows the experience of having to fire someone for animal
              brutality in the workplace. It's a dirty practice, and together
              we'll one day eliminate it from the creative environment once and
              for all.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the act of having to confront your employees and change their
              behavior is extremely tricky, no matter what their crime. And
              navigating these relationships is key to being an effective
              leader.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's look at an example:<br />Last month I gave a task to
              <a href="#">William</a>, the level designer on Stanley Parable,
              and this week I've decided to change the design and now everything
              he worked on this last month is useless. When conveying this to
              him, be sure to address the issue in as straightforward and direct
              a manner as possible.
            </p>
            <p>I've decided to do that by creating a flowchart:</p>
            <img src="Communication/Picture1.png" />
            <p>
              A few weeks later, William gets back to me with a response
              flowchart, just as I trained him to:
            </p>
            <img src="Communication/Picture2.png" />
            <p>
              See this is what healthy communication between teammates is
              supposed to look like.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's like jazz, an improvisational back-and-forth between creative
              equals. Each person supporting while also challenging the other.
              Two supernovas dancing in the sky. Beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've composed him another flowchart to help clarify the situation
              (<a href="Communication/Picture3.png"
                >click for the full sized version</a
              >):
            </p>
            <img src="Communication/Picture3.png" />
            <p>Another victory for healthy communication.</p>
            <p>And here's William's response:</p>
            <img src="Communication/Picture4.png" />
            <p>
              What's the responsible way to handle this situation? Is it to make
              another flowchart? Almost certainly.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what kind of leader would I be if I simply gave William
              another flowchart to explain all of his problems? If he can't
              discover his own inner flaws without me, how will he every learn?
              <a href="#">How will he ever learn??</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm going to go into complete and total radio silence for a few
              months, essentially conveying to William that I have disappeared
              off the face of the earth. Perhaps in time he will find the
              strength within him to make this entire game by himself to my own
              personal benefit.
            </p>
            <p>

              bears in the workplace.

              The Stanley Parable Dev Showcase: Distribution

              This week: <strong>Distribution of The Stanley Parable</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The world of video game distribution is scary. Just look at the
              facts:
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2012 alone, 100,000 people attempted to purchase video games,
              and yet only&nbsp;<b>1,400</b>were able too. That's down
              from&nbsp;<b>150,000/2,300</b>&nbsp;in 2011 by a factor of
              nearly&nbsp;<b>twice as much</b>. And as far as we can
              tell,&nbsp;<b>every single person</b>&nbsp;who has ever purchased
              a video game has died or will die.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facts don't lie, and they're even worse at cheering you up.
              Will video games ever win the Barrack Obama Cultural Relevance
              award if the people who purchase them keep dying? When will it
              end?
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture6.png" />
            <p>
              Sure, you're likely to tell me about the methods of distribution
              we already have in place, Steam, Origin, GoG, Gamestop, robbing
              your friend outside of Gamestop, being robbed outside of Gamestop
              and going back in and purchasing another game, the list goes on
              and on. But do you FEEL any safer? Of course you don't. That's
              what video games are doing to us.
            </p>
            <p>There is a better way.</p>
            <p>
              Although the Stanley Parable secured distribution via Steam on
              their Greenlight service, today I am announcing that we will be
              rescinding this offer in favor of a new distribution outlet
              created specifically for The Stanley Parable. The dark era of
              fearing for your life every time you attempt to purchase a game is
              over.
            </p>
            <p>Let me explain how our model works:</p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture7.png" />
            <p>
              Decide to buy a game. We intend to license other games for
              purchase in the future, but until that time the only game you'll
              be able to decide to purchase is The Stanley Parable.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the most difficult step, but it's also the most important.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture8.png" />
            <p>
              Tattoo the name of the game you want to exactly fill the distance
              between each of your nipples.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's also encouraged that you make the tattoo as visually
              interesting as possible, like depicting characters from the game
              you're purchasing forming letters of the title with their body
              (see Step 7)
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture9.png" />
            <p>
              When you wake up the next morning, you'll find a second tattoo has
              been printed on your body in the night. The visual quality of the
              second tattoo will correspond with that of the first, so you
              really want to be sure that first one is up to par.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second tattoo will have an address. The address has been
              randomly selected from Google Maps. You have 2 hours to get there
              from when you wake up. If you fail this deadline, the bomb in your
              liver will go off. You have a bomb in your liver. The person who
              gave you the first tattoo put it there. They work for us. Don't
              bother going back to the tattoo parlor. It isn't there any more.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture10.png" />
            <p>
              Go to the address. You'll see a man, or maybe a woman, or maybe
              nobody. Either way it's a good sign, means everything's going
              according to plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              When someone or no one shows up, greet them with a printout of
              this picture.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture11.png" />
            <p>The person is blind, they can't see it.</p>
            <p>What were you thinking??</p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture12.png" />
            <p>
              Instead, they'll tattoo a second address on your chest below the
              first. They didn't bring any actual tattooing equipment, so you
              should probably expect an extraordinary amount of pain while all
              of this is happening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also they're blind so the tattoo is probably just generally going
              to be nonsense. Ignore the tattoo, we'll send someone to your
              house.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture13.png" />
            <p>
              Take a minute to think about how if you were at Gamestop right now
              you'd be getting robbed by your friends.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture14.png" />
            <p>
              A week later, a man will show up at your house. He'll look he's
              just here to deliver pizza. He is. You ordered pizza.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture15.png" />
            <p>
              A month after that, a woman will arrive who actually works for us.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will present to her a 10-slide powerpoint presentation
              detailing why you deserve to purchase the video game. Here's an
              example of a slide you might use:
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture16.png" />
            <p>
              As she watches your presentation the woman will give you lots of
              little patronizing laughs and roll her eyes whenever you try to
              make a point, and at the end she'll resignedly say something like
              “well I guess I can run it by someone for a second opinion.”
              She'll eat something you were specifically saving for later and
              then head out the door.
            </p>
            <img src="Distribution/Picture17.png" />
            <p>
              The woman will then make this exact same presentation to another
              executive, who in turn will perform it for another, and another,
              eventually circling back around to the woman who started it. By
              this point, every member will have forgotten they ever heard the
              speech, and so will re-hear it, re-learn it, and re-present it
              over and over, in an endless, beautiful dance, forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's visualize this process for a more in-depth understanding:

            <p>This week: <strong>How to drop everything and quit</strong></p>
            <p>
              It's a question that's been asked over and over, throughout the
              ages, by every person who's ever set out to create something:
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              Is now the right time<br />
              to abandon everything I've been working on<br />
              in an emotional rage?
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone handles this question differently. Some people flip a
              coin, some people flip hundreds of coins in a series of
              multi-tiered coin-flipping tournaments, and there are even people
              who meticulously craft their own same-sided coins in order to
              guarantee a particular outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              But these are generally considered to be ancient methodologies,
              outdated and obsolete in this modern era. For the contemporary
              craftsman there is only one truly reliable source for answers, one
              that can be trusted to deliver without any concern for
              failure:Rolf
            </p>
            <p>
              Rolf lives on a 12'x12' island located in the very center of
              Indonesia:
            </p>
            <img src="Signing Off/Picture22.png" />
            <p style="background-color: black; font-size: smaller">
              There he has a single desk and computer. He has committed himself
              to two things: helping creatives figure out when to quit in a
              huff, and never dying. Rolf will be there for our children, and
              our children's children, and the people our children's children
              dress up in children's clothing to impersonate their biological
              children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rolf is single-handedly responsible for nearly every major
              decision to completely abandon one's work in a violent rage over
              the last 4 decades or so. He's become a touchstone in the creative
              community, and to speak personally for a moment, he's shaped my
              own development process in countless ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, for a minute let me share with you some of the exchanges
              between myself and Rolf that demonstrate the impact he's had on my
              game development:
            </p>
            <img src="Signing Off/Picture23.png" />
            <p>
              Rolf didn't give me an answer because he knew that the real answer
              was inside of me, that I had to search deep within myself for the
              true path forward. I didn't quit development on that day, because
              Rolf taught me to think for myself, to not give up on my pursuits.
            </p>
            <p>
              And your questions don't always need to be just about the right
              time to quit everything you're doing, Rolf is delighted to answer
              any questions you may have!
            </p>

            <p>Rolf is wisdom, Rolf is guidance.</p>
            <p>Here's a more recent email exchange between the two of us:</p>
            <img src="Signing Off/Picture25.png" /><br />
            <img src="Signing Off/Picture26.png" />
            <p>
              Just as always, Rolf had the perfect solution to all of my
              problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only hard part now is going to be putting it all into action.
              And I think I know just where to start.

            <p>My work is complete.</p>
            <p>I've done everything I could.</p>
            <p>All I need now is the final approval from Rolf.</p>
            <p>He alone knows whether I can quit.</p>
            <p>Whether I can abandon the HDS recklessly.</p>
            <p>Have I done enough?</p>
            <p>When his email arrives I tear it open with shaking hands:</p>

              The Helpful Development Showcase has been so much fun to make and
              to share with all of you I couldn't even possibly say. Thank you
              for joining me on this little experiment! There are many more
              experiments out there left to tackle, and right now I've got a big
              one left to wrap up. The Stanley Parable will be done before too
              much longer, and I'm absolutely bursting to share it with you all.

              So that's where I am going to be putting all my time and energy
              for the next few months, into finishing the game. We've been
              working on this thing for quite a long time, and I'm just about
              ready to put it to a close.<br />
              Let's make a video game. Let's make a video game.
